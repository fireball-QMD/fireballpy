abstract = {The package fhi98PP allows one to generate norm-conserving pseudopotentials adapted to density-functional theory total-energy calculations for a multitude of elements throughout the periodic table, including first-row and transition metal elements. The package also facilitates a first assessment of the pseudopotentials' transferability, either in semilocal or fully separable form, by means of simple tests carried out for the free atom. Various parameterizations of the local-density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation for exchange and correlation are implemented.}
